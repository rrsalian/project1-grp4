## Features
<!-- what the application does> -->
- Allows a user to set a weekly budget by inputing it into an available numbers field.
- After selecting an expense catagory pertaining to what was purchased, the user can specify the cost of the item, and the program will store the value in an array.
- The catagories the user can choose from are...

    "Entertainment" :movie_camera:,

    "Food" :pizza:,

    "Clothing" :shirt:,

    "Bills" :chart_with_downwards_trend:

- Values are added every time the user inputs an expense.
- At a certain point (when the remaining balance would reach 10% or under), the program warns the user to maintain a balance over 10%.

- A pie chart placed at the center of the screen provides visual feedback about expenses made thus far.

<!-- technologies used> -->
